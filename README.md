# DataStructuresProject1
This porject was done with my collegue Fatima Jabarti in September 2016
Part of my data structes and algorithm course was to implement a doubly-linked list and use it for storing and poping scores of a game
The proejct consists of four classes
  1. GameEntry -> for creating a game entry object consisting of name and score
  2. ScoreBoard -> a doubly-linked list for storing GameEntry objects
  3. ProjectCS2101 -> Main class
  4. GUInterface -> another way of representation rather than the console
